## Introduction

Salmon-AI is a web-based front-end designed to interact with a machine learning model that assesses Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) risk levels. This application aims to provide **clinical decision support** in healthcare by interpreting lab results and offering actionable insights based on explainable AI methods.

-----

## Features

  * **CSV Input**: Easily upload patient lab results in CSV format.
  * **Patient Demographics**: Input patient age and gender for comprehensive analysis.
  * **MMA Risk Level Display**: Clearly presents the calculated MMA risk level.
  * **Actionable Insights**: Provides immediate actions to be taken based on the MMA risk level.
  * **Extended Report Generation (Planned)**: Option to generate detailed reports for in-depth analysis.

-----

## Usage

### Web Application Usage

To use the Salmon-AI web application:

1.  **Upload Lab Results**: Click "Kies bestand" (Choose file) to upload your patient's lab results in CSV format.
2.  **Select Patient ID**: Use the "Select patient ID" button (functionality to be integrated with backend).
3.  **Enter Patient Information**:
      * Type the age of the patient in the designated field.
      * Select the gender of the patient from the dropdown menu.
4.  **View MMA Risk Level**: The "MMA - Risk level" section will display the calculated MMA level.
5.  **Review Actions**: Refer to the "Action - Per risk level" table for interpretations and immediate ICU actions corresponding to the determined MMA level.
6.  **Generate Extended Report (Optional)**: Check the "Generate extended report" switch if a more detailed analysis is required.

### How to Run (Model Training & Evaluation)

To run the machine learning model training and evaluation components:

#### 1\. Prepare Datasets

Place `labeled_MMA_data.csv` in the project root.

Then run all cells in:

```bash
DataPreparation.ipynb
```

This will generate all required CSVs for model training.

#### 2\. Train & Evaluate Models

To run all experiments:

```bash
python run_all_experiments.py
```

This script applies multiple models on all datasets and saves results to `ml_experiment_results.csv`.

#### 3\. Visualize Evaluation

To visualize the evaluation results (F1, Accuracy):

```bash
EvaluationResultsVisualization.ipynb
```

This will generate comparison plots and LaTeX-style tables for reporting.
